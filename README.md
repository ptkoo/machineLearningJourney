Overview
Today, I reviewed the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. Below is a summary of the concepts and key points from each topic.

Topics Reviewed
1. Linear Regression
Definition: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Key Points:
Assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the single output variable.
Objective: Minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.
Commonly evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
2. Logistic Regression
Definition: A statistical method for predicting binary outcomes from a set of continuous or categorical predictor variables.
Key Points:
Uses the logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
Outputs probabilities that can be converted to binary outcomes using a threshold (e.g., 0.5).
Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC score.
3. Decision Trees
Definition: A non-linear predictive model that maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value.
Key Points:
Comprised of nodes representing decisions or conditions, with branches denoting the outcomes of these decisions.
Easy to interpret and visualize.
Prone to overfitting but can be mitigated using techniques like pruning.
4. Gradient Boosting
Definition: An ensemble technique that combines the predictions of several base estimators to improve robustness and accuracy.
Key Points:
Builds models sequentially, with each new model attempting to correct the errors of the previous ones.
Commonly used variants include Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost, and LightGBM.
Effective in handling various types of data and achieving high predictive performance.
5. Neural Networks
Definition: Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected groups of artificial neurons that process information using a connectionist approach.
Key Points:
Consists of input, hidden, and output layers.
Can model complex non-linear relationships.
Trained using backpropagation and gradient descent methods.
Popular architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
