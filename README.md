### Overview
Today, I reviewed the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including Linear Regression.
### Topics Reviewed

#### 1. Linear Regression
- **Definition**: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Steps**:
  - Define Linear Hypothesis function
  - Cost Function to that Hypothesis function
  - Use Gradient Descent to minimize the cost function and get the parameters.
  - Boom! We have trained our linear regression model.

### Overview
Today, I reviewed the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including Logistic Regression.

#### 2. Logistic Regression
- **Definition**: A statistical method for predicting binary outcomes from a set of continuous or categorical predictor variables.
- **Key Points**:
  - Uses for classificaiton problems
  - The idea is basically finding the linear candidate line from the probability candidate line. 
  - First, project the data to linear candidate line, then using sigmoid funciton, convert it to proabilty candidate line.
  - Cost function is likelyhood. The goal is to find maximum likelyhood. 
  - Use gradient descent/ascent according to you equation. 

#### 3. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour )
- **Definition**: A simple, learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.
- **Key Points**:
  - Non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm.
  - Calculate Euclidean Distance, Sort the distances, Find the K-neighbours
  - Take the hightest neighbour group to classify
